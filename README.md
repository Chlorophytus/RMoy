# RMoy
Simple 12V 0.5A headphone amplifier convergent with the CMoy's design and philosophy. This is in early alpha stage but will be on Tindie soon.

## Background
Initially named "Seven Wonder", I realized that this converged with the famous CMoy headphone amplifier, freely available. I decided to open source it for others to enjoy.

## Specifications
- Gain is about 8x
- OPA2134 opamp (in the process of testing other opamps out there but this seems to be most happy)
- Nichicon UKA capacitors in the signal path (needed for coupling)
- The same magenta LED used in the BD139 Thing

## Caveats
- No knob like the CMoy has, computers and other devices have digital OS volume control. Use those.
